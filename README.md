<h1 align=center> Open Source Computer Science Degree </h1>

This repo documents my work towards pursuing an undergrad Computer Science majors through open-sourced, university-level MOOC's that meets the requrements of **MIT's** [_Computer Science and Engineering (6-3)_](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/).

Since, I already have a majors in Mechanical Engineering I have omitted general education and non-CS course requirements.

Curriculum was an adaptation of [_MIT CS degree_](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/) and was also inspired by [![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) . Majority of the courses were
available through MIT's Open Courseware and when available, courses with more interative versions from other universities (Stanford, UW, CMU, Harvard, UCSD, IIT) were opted.

All the course selected were based on these criteria.

**Courses must _______**
* have video lectures or good reading materials to follow along.
* have good set of assignments demonstrating those concepts in practice.
* have some form of autograder to evaluate my work.

All the courses are classified into three categories.
- **_Introductory_** : Getting started in CS.
- **_Core_** : corresponds roughly to first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take.
- **_Advanced_** : corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, selecting electives according to my interests.
